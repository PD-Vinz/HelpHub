Hi, Good day!

Regarding your request for a DHVSU Google Account, we suggest that you kindly approach your Dean/Director as they are the ones who can affirm the need for the account for assurance and security purposes. They are the ones who will request an account in the Google Form. Hope this helps.

Thank you & God Bless
